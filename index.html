            <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            I am a 32 year old graduate from UCSB. I have a double major in Asian American Studies and Cultural Anthropology. 
            After college, I work in the public relations field focusing on Asian American cross over movies / stars. Figured I 
            wanted to do it with Disney so I left for the Disney College Program and started at the Disneyland Resort. I went through
            some events training and ended up in fine dining for the resort. I focus on wine and being a sommelier for the Carthay Circle 
            Restaurant at California Adventure

    <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
            Even though serving and Disney pay well, I wanted to work in tech but had no idea where to start. My friends mentioned 
            coding and web development so I took a couple classes to see if I was interested. I enjoyed taking class at the local
            community college and decided I wanted to take it to the next level so I signed up for the UCI bootcamp.
